### About gJLS2

A joint analysis of location-scale (JLS) can be a powerful tool in genome-wide association studies to uncover previously overlooked markers that influence the quantitative traits through both mean and variance (Soave et al., 2015; AJHG). The gJLS2 package offers updated software support to previous versions [JLS](https://github.com/dsoave/JLS) and [gJLS](https://github.com/dsoave/gJLS), which were developed to deal specifically with sample correlation and group uncertainty (Soave and Sun, 2017; Biometrics). Although the work was originally motivated by genetic association studies, application of the proposed method, however, is not limited to this type of data. The JLS testing framework is useful for other scientific studies where location and scale parameters are both of interest.

The current gJLS2 can additionally handle analyses of X-chromosomes through the recently available association testing methods for location (Chen et al., 2020; Biostatistics) and scale (Deng et al., 2019; Genetic Epidemiology). The package offers a convenient PLINK R-plugin script and a command-line Rscript for non-GUI usage.
