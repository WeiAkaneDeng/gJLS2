  GENO,
  Y,
  COVAR = NULL,
  SEX = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{GENO}{a list of a genotype matrix/vector of SNPs, must contain values 0, 1, 2's coded for the number of reference allele. Alternatively, for imputed genotypes, it could either be a vector of dosage values between 0 and 2, or a list of matrix of genotype probabilities, numerically between 0 and 1 for each genotype. The length/dimension of \code{GENO} should match that of \code{Y}, and/or \code{SEX} and \code{COVAR}.}

\item{Y}{a vector of quantitative traits, such as human height.}

\item{COVAR}{optional: a vector or matrix of covariates that are used to reduce bias due to confounding, such as age.}

\item{SEX}{optional: the genetic sex of individuals in the sample population, must be a vector of 1 and 2 following the default sex code is 1 for males and 2 for females in PLINK.}

\item{Xchr}{a logical indicator for whether the analysis is for X-chromosome SNPs.}

\item{transformed}{a logical indicating whether the quantitative response \code{Y} should be transformed using a rank-based method to resemble a normal distribution; recommended for traits with non-symmetric distribution. The default option is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{loc_alg}{a character indicating the type of algorithm to compute the centre in stage 1; the value is either "OLS", corresponding to an ordinary linear regression under Gaussian assumptions to compute the mean, or "LAD", corresponding to a quantile regression to compute the median. The recommended default option is "LAD". For the quantile regression, the function calls \code{quantreg::rq} and the median is estimated using either the "br" (smaller samples) or "sfn" (larger samples and sparse problems) algorithm depending the sample size, for more details see \code{?quantreg::rq}.}

\item{related}{optional: a logical indicating whether the samples should be treated as related; if \code{TRUE} while no relatedness covariance information is given, it is then estimated under a \code{cov.structure} and assumes this structure among all within-group errors pertaining to the same pair/cluster if specified using \code{clust}. This option currently only applies to autosomal SNPs.}

\item{cov.structure}{optional: should be one of standard classes of correlation structures listed in \code{corClasses} from \pkg{R} package \pkg{nlme}. See \code{?corClasses}. The most commonly used option is \code{corCompSymm} for a compound symmetric correlation structure. This option currently only applies to autosomal SNPs.}

\item{clust}{optional: a factor indicating the grouping of samples; it should have at least two distinct values. It could be the family ID (FID) for family studies. This option currently only applies to autosomal SNPs.}

\item{genotypic}{a logical indicating whether the variance homogeneity should be tested with respect to an additively (linearly) coded or non-additively coded \code{geno_one}. The former has one less degree of freedom than the latter and is the default option. For dosage genotypes without genotypic probabilities, \code{genotypic} is forced to be \code{FALSE}.}

\item{origLev}{a logical indicator for whether the reported p-values should also include original Levene's test.}

\item{centre}{a character indicating whether the absolute deviation should be calculated with respect to "median" or "mean" in the traditional sex-specific and Fisher combined Levene's test p-values (three tests) for X-chromosome. The default value is "median". This option applies to sex-specific analysis using original Levene's test (i.e. when \code{regression}$$=$$\code{TRUE}).}

\item{nCores}{optional: an integer for the number of processors/cores to split the computation. The default option is 1, without parallelizing. To check the maximum number allowed for your machine try: \code{parallel::detectCores()}.}
}
\value{
a vector of Levene's test regression p-values according to the models
specified.
}
\description{
This function takes as input the genotype of SNPs (\code{GENO}), the SEX (\code{SEX}), and a quantitative trait (\code{Y}) in a sample population, and possibly additional covariates, such as principal components. The function returns the scale association \emph{p}-values for each SNP.
}
\note{
We recommend to quantile-normally transform \code{Y} to avoid ‘scale-effect’ where
the variance values tend to be proportional to mean values when stratified by \code{GENO}.
}
\examples{
N <- 1000
genoDAT <- rbinom(N, 2, 0.3)
sex <- rbinom(N, 1, 0.5)+1
Y <- rnorm(N)
covar <- matrix(rnorm(N*10), ncol=10)

# vanilla example:

scaleReg(GENO=list(genoDAT, genoDAT), Y=Y, COVAR=covar)
scaleReg(GENO=list(genoDAT, genoDAT), Y=Y, COVAR=covar, genotypic=TRUE)
scaleReg(GENO=list(genoDAT, genoDAT), Y=Y, COVAR=covar, origLev = TRUE)
scaleReg(GENO=list(genoDAT, genoDAT), Y=Y, COVAR=covar, origLev = TRUE, SEX=sex)

# parallel demonstration; NOT RUN
#largerG <- matrix(rep(genoDAT,each=100), ncol=100, byrow=TRUE)
#system.time(scaleReg(GENO=largerG, nCores=1, Y=Y, COVAR=covar))
#system.time(scaleReg(GENO=largerG, nCores=2, Y=Y, COVAR=covar))
#system.time(scaleReg(GENO=replicate(100, genoDAT, simplify=FALSE),
#Y=Y, COVAR=covar, origLev = TRUE, SEX=sex, nCores=2))
